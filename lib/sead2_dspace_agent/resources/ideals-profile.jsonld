<p>To properly administer the Illinois Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship
(IDEALS) and preserve the contents for future use, the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois on
behalf of its Urbana-Champaign campus (the \"University\") requires certain permissions and warrants
from you, the author(s) and/or copyright owner. If you are the copyright owner, by accepting this license,
you still retain copyright to your work and do not give up the right to submit the work to publishers or
other repositories. If you are not the copyright owner, you represent that the copyright owner has given
you permission to deposit the work.<\/p>
<p>By accepting (clicking through) this license, you grant to the University the non-exclusive right to
reproduce, translate (as described below), and distribute the submission, including the descriptive
information (metadata) and abstract, in any format or medium worldwide and royalty-free, including, but
not limited to, publication over the Internet, except as provided for by an addendum to this agreement.
When provided, the University will clearly identify your name(s) as the author(s) or copyright owner(s) of
the submission as well as the name(s) of the copyright owner(s) if different from your name(s), include a
statement of your copyright, and will not make any alteration, other than as allowed by this license, to
your submission.<\/p>
<p>You agree that the University may translate the submission to any medium or format for the purposes of
security, back-up, and preservation. You agree that the University may make multiple copies of the
submission for the purposes of security, back-up, and preservation.
If you cannot make all of the following representations, then you shall contact the IDEALS Staff at
ideals-gen@illinois.edu before proceeding further. In order to make this submission, you represent that:<\/p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>You have the right to grant the rights contained in the license.<\/li>
<li>This submission does not, to the best of your knowledge, infringe on anyone's copyright or other
intellectual property rights.<\/li>
<li>If the submission does contain material for which you do not hold copyright and that exceeds fair
use, you have obtained the unrestricted permission of the copyright owner to grant the University
the rights required by this license and that such third-party owned material is clearly identified
and acknowledged within the text or content of the submission.<\/li>
<li>The submission does not contain any confidential information, proprietary information of others
or export controlled information.<\/li>
<li>There are not any restrictions or required publication delays on the distribution of the submission
by the University.<\/li>
<li>The information you provide about the submission is accurate.<\/li>
<\/ol>
<\/p>
<p>You understand that if copyright terms for, or ownership of, the submission change, it is your
responsibility to notify the University of these changes.
You understand that you may request that the submission be withdrawn from IDEALS, and, in
such an event, the descriptive information (metadata) will be retained and a copy of the submission 
will be retained in a 'dark archive' where it is no longer publicly accessible. The exception to this is
requests to withdraw theses and dissertations electronically deposited with the Graduate College; in
those cases, you understand that you must contact the Graduate College at thesis@illinois.edu to
make such a request.<\/p>
<p>If the submission is based upon work that has been sponsored or supported by an agency or organization
other than the University, you must fulfill any right of review or other obligations required by the contract
or agreement with such an agency or organization before depositing into IDEALS.
By accepting this license, you acknowledge that you have read and agreed to the terms of this agreement
and all related IDEALS and University policies.<\/p>
